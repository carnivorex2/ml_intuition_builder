# Phase 10 Assignment — Public Artifact: Publish, Teach, or Build

## Core Objective

This phase installs the final transformation:

> Mastery is proven when you can externalize it clearly.

You will create a durable, public-quality artifact that demonstrates:

- Technical depth
- Evaluation rigor
- System thinking
- Research discipline
- Strategic tradeoffs
- Governance awareness

This is not another experiment.

This is something that could be shown to:
- A hiring committee
- A research lab
- A startup board
- A senior engineering panel

# Choose One Track

You must choose ONE of the following tracks.

---

# Track A — Research-Style Paper

Produce a paper-quality document (8–15 pages equivalent) containing:

- Abstract
- Introduction
- Related Work (brief but thoughtful)
- Method
- Experimental Setup
- Results
- Robustness Analysis
- Limitations
- Conclusion

Requirements:

- Includes distribution shift analysis
- Includes ablations
- Includes failure analysis
- Includes tradeoff discussion
- Fully reproducible

It must read like a workshop-level submission.

---

# Track B — End-to-End System Case Study

Produce a deep technical case study of a system you built (Phase 6 or extended).

Include:

- Problem framing
- Data pipeline design
- Modeling decisions
- Evaluation rigor
- Distribution shift analysis
- Production constraints
- Monitoring strategy
- Postmortem of failures
- What you would redesign

This must read like a senior engineering blog post
or internal technical design review document.

Clarity matters more than complexity.

---

# Track C — Teaching Artifact

Create a teaching-quality resource that explains one major concept deeply:

Examples:

- Why random splits break time series forecasting
- When bag-of-words beats neural networks
- How multimodal fusion fails silently
- Why distribution shift is the real problem in ML
- Designing evaluation protocols under constraint

Your artifact may be:

- A long-form essay
- A structured tutorial repository
- A mini-course outline
- A technical video script (written)

It must:

- Contain concrete examples
- Include experiments or demonstrations
- Include visualizations or thought experiments
- Anticipate misunderstandings

If you cannot teach it clearly,
you do not fully understand it.

---

# Mandatory Components (All Tracks)

Regardless of track, your artifact must include:

1. Explicit tradeoff discussion  
2. Failure mode analysis  
3. Distribution shift reasoning  
4. Evaluation protocol clarity  
5. Limitations section  

No artifact is complete without limitations.

---

# Quality Standards

Your submission must:

- Be logically structured
- Avoid vague claims
- Include quantitative evidence
- Avoid hype language
- Be defensible under questioning

Ask yourself:

- Could I defend every claim in this document?
- Does this show judgment?
- Does this demonstrate depth rather than breadth?

---

# Reflection Document

In `reflection.md`, answer:

1. What did you understand in Phase 0 that you misunderstood?
2. Which phase changed your thinking most?
3. What instinct now feels automatic?
4. Where are you still weak?
5. What will you continue studying?

This is mandatory.

---

# Completion Criteria

You are done when:

- You can produce a public-facing artifact at senior level.
- Your reasoning is visible, not just your results.
- You anticipate critique.
- You show restraint in complexity.
- You demonstrate synthesis across all phases.

---

# Why This Phase Matters

Skill is internal.

Reputation is externalized skill.

If you cannot package your thinking clearly,
your mastery remains invisible.

Phase 10 ensures:

- You can articulate.
- You can defend.
- You can synthesize.
- You can teach.

At this point, you are no longer progressing through a curriculum.

You are operating independently.

This is the final phase.
